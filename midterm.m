% 1a. Write the Matlab script that forms and plots the amplitude normalized impulse
% response for 3 SQRT Nyquist harris taper filters containing 20 symbols with
% 4-samples per symbol for values of alpha = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6. Use harris taper
% filter designed with sqrt_nyq_y2 script.

% 1b. Write the Matlab script that modulates 1000 symbols of shaped QPSK input
% data for each of the three SQRT Nyquist filters. Plot the first 400 samples
% (100 symbols) of the real part of the three modulated series on a single
% figure with three subplots.
